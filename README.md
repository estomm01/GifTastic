When the user clicked on a button the page will grab 10 static giphy's, non animated images from the Giphy API and place them on a page. 

When the curser clicks on the still GIPHY images the gif will animate. IF the user licks the gif again, the gif will stop animating.

Also added a form to youir pages takes a value from a user input box with a click button. Then makes a funtion to add the topic into the array. 

Click and have fun.
